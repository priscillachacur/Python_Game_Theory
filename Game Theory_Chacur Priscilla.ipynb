    "There are 2 drivers both in separate cars and in different and opposite directions but on the same road.\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to construction on the road, only one car can go through at once, therefore the drivers have to make a decision on whether to continue driving and risking for a collision or to stop and wait for the other car to pass by. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, both drivers want to go through the road as soon as possible regardless of the other driver's choice. If both give in and decides to wait, there is no car collision. There is also the possibility that one of the drivers waits and the others crosses the road, or the other way around. In this case, the player who is able to cross the road is benefited. Finally, the last possibility is that both of them decides not to wait, and both cross at the same time resulting in a car collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drivers decisions are completely independent of one another and one does not know what the other one will decide to do. If they both decide to wait, they are both safe. However, if no one decides to wait, they collide. Otherwise, one benefits from crossing the road faster, and the other one waits."
